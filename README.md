# Byte Animation

> Inspired by the [ByteBeat music genre](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat) of algorithmic art

This consists on drawing graphics and doing animations on a raw pixel canvas by providing a stream of data (usually bytes, but could be `DWORD`s)

## Website

Generates frames from a stream of bytes returned by a math or bitwise expression. Currently, it's a hardcoded sine-based expression. This will change in the future when I implement arbitrary expressions and code.

## Plans
I may add stuff that doesn't belong to websites, like examples of Byte-Anim expressions made by me and the community, available in many langs such as JS, C, and Rust
