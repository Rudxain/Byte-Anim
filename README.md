Inspired by the [ByteBeat music genre](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat) of algorithmic art

# What the website does
Generates frames from a stream of bytes returned by a math or bitwise expression. Currently, it's a hardcoded sine-based expression. This will change in the future when I implement arbitrary expressions and code.

# Other plans for this repo
I may add stuff that doesn't belong to websites, like C, C++, and Rust examples of Byte-Anim code, made by me and the community
